The Benefits of Reading English Books</a>
    “The more that you read, the more that you’ll know. The more that
    you know, the more places you’ll go.” – Dr. Seuss.
    As any English-speaking child can tell you, there is no denying
    Dr. Seuss. If you love to read, but you’re a little afraid of reading
    a full-on novel in English, don’t worry. We’re going to help you get
    there, step by step. With every book you read, the more you’ll improve.</p>
    <p>
    To get started, there are some excellent novels written in English that
    are not too difficult to understand. Anyway, it’s good to set yourself
    a language challenge now and again.
    How else are you going to improve in English?
    Reading is rewarding.
    Being able to read a novel in another language and understand
    it is a huge achievement. You’ll feel accomplished the moment
    you read that final page, close the book, and reflect on the experience.
    zou might find yourself at the last page faster than you thought
    – once you begin reading these books, you won’t be able to put them down.</p>
